### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Marjona6/Marjona6** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
* job hunting (I'm currently available for frontend roles, including freelance, short-term, contract, etc.) 🔍
* doing some contract/freelance work, as well as pro bono work for people and causes I feel strongly about

🌱 I’m currently learning ...
* European Portuguese 🇵🇹
* fencing 🤺

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
* interesting projects (I'm interested in a LOT, so try me)
* building websites for women who need them (got a side project? small business? NGO? I want to help you! Get in touch!)

🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
* my current job search (know anyone hiring experienced frontend developers?) 🔍
* how I might transition into a role that's more focused on UX and/or project management

💬 Ask me about ...
* React, styled components, getting started as a developer after a career change, my opinions.
* Fencing, sailing, hiking, sports.

⚡ Fun facts: ...
* There are estimated to be around 30,000 different varieties of apples around the world, but only about 1% of them are sold commercially.
* Only two national flags in the world incorporate the color purple.
* Women make up only 11% of web developers. Oops, that one's not actually fun.
