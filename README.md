### Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently learning ...
* UI architecture 👷‍♀️
* European Portuguese 🇵🇹
* sailing ⛵

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
* Realistically, nothing right now. I have a lot on my plate at the moment.
* HOWEVER, I'm always happy to chat with female developers. There are too few of us, and we need to support one another.

🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
* my current job search (know anyone hiring experienced frontend developers?) 🔍

💬 Ask me about ...

⚡ Fun facts: ...
* There are estimated to be around 30,000 different varieties of apples around the world, but only about 1% of them are sold commercially.
* Only two national flags in the world incorporate the color purple.
* Women make up only 11% of web developers. Oops, that one's not actually fun.
